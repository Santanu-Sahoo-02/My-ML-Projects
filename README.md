### 6: Polynomial Linear Regression 
Program 1: TO fit the Simple Linear Regression and Polynomial Linear  Regression models to Salary_Position.csv data and to find which one is more
accurately fitting to the given data. Also to predict the salaries of employees.

Program 2: To take Salary_Experience.csv dataset and do analysis with  Polynomial Linear Regression for the degree 5 and to do the following 
a) draw the scatter plot with regression line b) find coefficients, intercept, accuracy of model and e) predict the salary of an employee having certain years of experience.

### 7: Ridge Regression

Program 2: To use boston_houses.csv and by taking only 'RM' and Price' of the  houses, divide the data as training and testing data. Finally, to fit the line using Ridge regression and find the price of a house if it contains some certain rooms.

### 8: Lasso Regression
Program 1: To use Lasso regression on Boston house prices, and select the best feature that mostly influences the output (price of the house).

Program 2: To find out which media has infiuenced sales more using Lasso Regression model [Given the money spent on TV, radio and newspaper]

### 9: ElasticNet Regression
Program 1: To select the most appropriate feature of Boston housing dataset  using Elastic Net Regression model.

Program 2: To create ElasticNet model and find out  which factor is most determining factor for diabetes in Indians.

### 10: Logistic Regression
Program 1: To apply Logistic Regression Model and predict whether a person takes insurance or not based on his age.  [given data like age and bought _insurance]

Program 2: To apply Logistic Regression Model so as to analyze the data to know why employecs are leaving a company and when they will stay back in the company.

Program 3: To use Logistic Regression Machine Learning model to classify hand written digits.

### 11: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Programn l: To classify the iris flowers data set using SVM and find out the flower type depending on the given input data.

Program 2: To read data from hand written digits data set and apply SVM on it and analvse the data. Also, to predict the digits from the images of hand written digits.

### 12: Naive Bayes Classification
Program 1: To analyze the data using Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier and predict whether cricket can be played or not based on given new data. [Given weather data related to outlook, temperature,  humidity and windy]

Program 2: To take the SMS spam collection dataset and analyze which messages are spam and which are ham by creating a spam filter using Multinomial Naive Bayes Machine Learning Model.


### 13: KNN Classifier
Program 1: To use KNN model on Indian diabetes patients database and predict  whether a new patient is diabetic (1) or not (0).

### 14: Decision Trees
Program 1: To apply DecisionTreeClassifier Machine Learning Model to take a  decision whether to play cricket or not under given conditions.

Program 2: To use a decision tree machine learning  model to analyse employee salary data of various companies and then predict the salary of a new employee.

### 15: Random Forest
Program 1: To train the Random Forest on the scikit digits dataset and check if  the model is correctly predicting the handwritten digits.

Program 2: To train the Random Forest Classifier Machine Learning model on Employee experience and salary dataset and predict the salary of an employee when his experience is given. 


### 16: K-Means Clustering
Program 1: To use K- Means Machine Learming model and classify the employees into various income groups or clusters.

Program 2: To classify the iris flowers data set using K-Means Clustering model depending on petal length and petal widths of the flowers.

### 17: Apriori Algorithm
Program 1: To use Apriori algorithm on Market Basket Analysis to find the items which are bought together. [Minimum 2 or more items should be considered with 4 times more likelihood that a customer purchases these items in combination.]

### 18: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
